The whales have declared that they will only consider peace if you can prove that you know your whale facts, and maybe show that humanity has grown a little self-aware in the process. Now it's up to your wits, and your memory for whale trivia to stand between keeping the peace and an all out Whale War, that humanity cannot hope to win.</p>

                                                This is a timed multiple-choice quiz. After you hit start, you will have twenty seconds to answer the question. To do so, simply click on the button of the statement that best answers the whales' question. Your answers or lack thereof will be noted by the whales. When the time is up, the answer will be revealed and after a short waiting period the next question will begin. After all ten questions have been completed, the whales will judge humanity. If you fail, we have a backup plan. We have built a limited time-stream manipulator that will reset the timeline to before you began the quiz, so you can have multiple chances to get it right. Humanity is counting on you. Godspeed.
